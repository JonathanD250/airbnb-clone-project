### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A booking system must be easy to use. If the design is confusing, users will abandon the process before completing their booking. A user-friendly design reduces friction, builds trust, and improves conversion rates. It ensures users find properties quickly, understand the details clearly, and complete their booking without unnecessary steps.
